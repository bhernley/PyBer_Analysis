# PyBer_Challenge Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
An Analysis of rideshare fares throughout the 1st quarter by city type; Urban, Suburban, & Rural


## Results:
Data was analysized for each fare throught the year.  Each city was cateogorized as; Urban, Suburban, & Rural.

The analysis shows that as expected, the Urban areas had a greater amount of each; drivers, rides, total fares.  The suburban areas were nexted, followed by the Rural areas.  However there was an inverse effect for the fare amount per ride as the rural areas trended as the highest and the urban areas as the lowest average fare.  This is also expected as rural riders will generally need to travel a further distance to their destination as opposed the urban and suburban riders.
